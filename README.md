# MulmoChat

**MulmoChat is a research prototype exploring a new paradigm for multimodal AI chat experiences.**

Traditional chat interfaces are fundamentally text-based—users interact through messages and receive responses as text. MulmoChat reimagines this interaction model: users engage in natural conversation while simultaneously experiencing rich visual and interactive content directly on canvas.

The key insight: **AI conversations don't have to be limited to text streams.** By designing an architecture where visual experiences and language understanding coexist naturally, we enable a fundamentally different way of interacting with AI—one where images materialize, maps become explorable, games turn playable, all within the conversational flow.

MulmoChat demonstrates the architecture, design patterns, and user experience principles necessary to build truly multimodal chat interfaces where visual and textual communication work together seamlessly.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```sh
yarn install
```

Create .env file with following API keys:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
GEMINI_API_KEY=...
GOOGLE_MAP_API_KEY=... (optional, required for map features)
EXA_API_KEY=... (optional, required for AI-powered search)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... (optional, required for HTML generation)
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=... (optional, defaults to http://127.0.0.1:11434)
COMFYUI_BASE_URL=... (optional, defaults to http://127.0.0.1:8000)
COMFYUI_DEFAULT_MODEL=... (optional, defaults to flux1-schnell-fp8.safetensors)
COMFYUI_TIMEOUT_MS=... (optional, defaults to 300000ms / 5 minutes)
```

Start a development server:

```sh
yarn dev
```

When you open the browser, allow it to access the microphone. 

Click the "Start Voice Chat", and start talking to the AI, which has a capability to generate images.

## Text Model API

MulmoChat now exposes a provider-agnostic text generation API that can be consumed by the client or external integrations.

- `GET /api/text/providers` returns the configured providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, and Ollama) alongside default model suggestions and credential availability.
- `POST /api/text/generate` accepts `{ provider, model, messages, maxTokens?, temperature?, topP? }` and returns a normalized text response regardless of vendor.

Configure the relevant API keys to enable each provider; Ollama support assumes a local instance listening on `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` (defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:11434`).

### Quick Verification Scripts

With the dev server running (`yarn dev`), you can exercise the unified text API against each provider using the standalone scripts under `server/tests/`:

```sh
# OpenAI (requires OPENAI_API_KEY)
npx tsx server/tests/test-text-openai.ts "Write a haiku about MulmoChat"

# Anthropic (requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
npx tsx server/tests/test-text-anthropic.ts "How does tool calling help agents?"

# Google Gemini (requires GEMINI_API_KEY)
npx tsx server/tests/test-text-google.ts "Suggest onboarding tips for voice-first apps"

# Ollama (assumes local Ollama daemon)
npx tsx server/tests/test-text-ollama.ts "Explain how Ollama integrates with MulmoChat"
```

Each script prints the selected model and the normalized text returned from `POST /api/text/generate`, failing fast with logged diagnostics if the request or provider call does not succeed.

## ComfyUI Integration

MulmoChat integrates with the **ComfyUI Desktop application** for local image generation using advanced models like FLUX. This provides an alternative to cloud-based image generation with full control over models and workflows.

### Setup

1. **Install ComfyUI Desktop**: Download from [ComfyUI official site](https://www.comfy.org/)
2. **Launch ComfyUI Desktop**: The app runs a local API server (default port: 8000)
3. **Download Models**: Ensure you have compatible models installed (e.g., `flux1-schnell-fp8.safetensors`, `flux1-dev-fp8.safetensors`)
4. **Configure Environment Variables** (optional):
   ```
   COMFYUI_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
   COMFYUI_DEFAULT_MODEL=flux1-schnell-fp8.safetensors
   COMFYUI_TIMEOUT_MS=300000
   ```

### API Endpoint

- `POST /api/generate-image/comfy` - Generate images using ComfyUI workflows

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "prompt": "a beautiful landscape",
  "negativePrompt": "blurry, low quality",
  "model": "flux1-schnell-fp8.safetensors"
}
```

All parameters are optional except `prompt`. The API automatically selects optimal defaults based on the model:
- `width`, `height`: Image dimensions (auto: 1024×1024 for FLUX, 512×512 for SD)
- `steps`: Sampling steps (auto: 4 for FLUX Schnell, 20 for SD)
- `cfgScale`: Guidance scale (auto: 1.0 for FLUX, 8.0 for SD)
- `sampler`: Sampling method (auto: "euler" for FLUX, "dpmpp_2m_sde" for SD)
- `scheduler`: Noise schedule (auto: "simple" for FLUX, "karras" for SD)

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "images": ["base64-encoded-image-data"],
  "promptId": "uuid",
  "model": "flux1-schnell-fp8.safetensors",
  "metadata": { ... }
}
```

### Model-Specific Optimizations

The API automatically detects the model type and applies optimal parameters:

**FLUX Models** (flux1-schnell-fp8, flux1-dev-fp8):
- Resolution: 1024×1024 (default)
- Steps: 4 (Schnell is optimized for speed)
- CFG Scale: 1.0 (lower guidance works better)
- Sampler: euler
- Scheduler: simple
- Generation time: ~10-30 seconds after model loading

**Stable Diffusion Models** (v1-5-pruned-emaonly):
- Resolution: 512×512 (default)
- Steps: 20
- CFG Scale: 8.0
- Sampler: dpmpp_2m_sde
- Scheduler: karras

You can override these defaults by passing parameters in the request body.

### Notes

- First-time generation may take longer as the model loads into memory
- The default timeout is set to 5 minutes to accommodate model loading
- ComfyUI Desktop must be running for the API endpoint to work
- FLUX Schnell is optimized for speed with 4 steps, providing fast generation with good quality
