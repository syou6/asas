# Spreadsheet Generation Benchmark Summary

## How to Update This Summary

This summary is generated from benchmark results in `benchmark/results/`. To update:

1. **Run new benchmarks** to generate result files in `benchmark/results/[model-name]/`
2. **Re-evaluate existing results** with bug fixes: `npm run benchmark:re-evaluate`
3. **Regenerate summary** by asking Claude Code:
   ```
   update SUMMARY.md
   ```

### What to Include in Updates

When regenerating, ensure the summary includes:
- **Model Performance Rankings**: Table with avg score, pass rate, perfect rate, test completion
- **Performance by Level**: Analysis of Level 1 (Basic), Level 2 (Intermediate), Level 3 (Advanced)
- **Performance by Category**: Breakdown by test categories (Basic, Mathematical, Statistical, Text, Financial, Logical)
- **Test Case Analysis**: Individual test results with common issues identified
- **Key Findings**: Strengths and weaknesses across all models
- **Model-Specific Notes**: Unique characteristics of each model
- **Recommendations**: For model selection, benchmark improvement, and application development

### File Structure

Result files follow this pattern:
```
benchmark/results/
├── [model-name]/
│   └── run-[timestamp].json
```

Each result file contains:
- `metadata`: Model config and run info
- `summary`: Overall statistics (avgScore, passRate, etc.)
- `byLevel`: Performance grouped by difficulty level
- `byCategory`: Performance grouped by test category
- `results[]`: Individual test case results with detailed scoring

## Overview

This benchmark evaluates AI model performance on structured spreadsheet generation tasks using JSON format. Models are tested on their ability to generate spreadsheets with proper formulas, formatting, and calculations across various complexity levels and categories.

**Benchmark Run Date:** November 30, 2025 (latest result files)
**Re-evaluation Date:** November 27, 2025
**Total Test Cases:** 7 (Basic, Mathematical, Statistical, Text, Financial, Logical)

## Important Note: Verification & Test Fixes

**Major verifier fixes (Nov 26)** resolved six scoring bugs (result correctness columns, formula detection, formatting checks, cell priority, label matching, data presence) plus a statistical-01 expectation bug. Average scores increased by 10‑31 points.

**Semantic extractor (Nov 28):** Prefers numeric formula outputs before string formulas, solving logical-01 mislabeling.

**Spreadsheet engine (Nov 27):** Added `&` concatenation, string preservation, function registry bootstrapping, and quoting fixes. Text-01 went from 0% → 90% pass rate.

**Test fix (Nov 28):** `financial-01` now targets the "Total Interest Paid" row for assertions/formatting, preventing false "missing currency" warnings.

**Synonym support (Nov 27):** Verifier now accepts pipe-separated label alternatives (e.g., "Total|Sum") to handle different model wording. Applied to `statistical-01` test case, allowing both "Total" and "Sum of All Sales" as valid labels.

## Recommendations

### Model Selection
1. **Best overall:** All four top-tier models (gemini-3-pro-preview, claude-sonnet-4-5, claude-3.5-sonnet, claude-haiku-4-5) achieve perfect 100/100 averages.
2. **Best value:** claude-haiku-4-5 (perfect 100/100, lowest latency/cost among perfect scorers).
3. **Best Google option:** gemini-3-pro-preview for perfect accuracy, gemini-2.5-flash for speed/cost (92.9 average).
4. **Best OpenAI stack:** gpt-4o for reliability (92.9), gpt-4o-mini for budget workloads.
5. **Fast reasoning:** grok-4-1-fast-reasoning balances speed and accuracy.
6. **Privacy/offline (best):** ollama-gpt-oss-20b for local deployments (78.4 avg, 71% pass).
7. **Privacy/offline (budget):** ollama-mistral-small3.2-24b for resource-constrained environments (67.9 avg, 43% pass).

### Application Guidance
- Keep the verifier in loop for every generated spreadsheet.
- Provide explicit instructions for percentage budgets to avoid hard-coded totals.
- Use the text/financial tasks with confidence—engine and tests now reflect reality.
- For local deployments, pair Ollama outputs with automated verification to catch formatting slips.

### Benchmark Improvements
1. Add new scenarios (pivot tables, lookups, conditional formatting).
2. Introduce adversarial/error-handling cases.
3. Automate summary regeneration (scripts already output aggregated stats).
4. Continue auditing test-case expectations and add synonym support where appropriate (statistical-01, financial-01 fixes proved worthwhile).

### Next Steps
1. Re-run the benchmark after any new engine/verifier changes.
2. Expand test coverage (lookups, conditional formatting, error handling).
3. Cross-validate with Excel/Google Sheets outputs where possible.
4. Provide targeted prompts/examples for the budget test to improve pass rates.

With the re-evaluated results and updated tests, the benchmark now accurately captures the state of LLM spreadsheet generation.
